# Game Development
## Introduction
Unity lets you test your game in the IDE without having to perform any kind of export or build. When you run code in Unity, youâ€™re using Mono version 3.5, which has API compatibility roughly on par with that of the .NET Framework 3.5/CLR 2.0.
## Objective
* Learn to navigate the unity editor comfortably.
* Learn how to add and manipulate objects.
* Learn how to control game objects using C#.
